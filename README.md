# This is a Java Program to implement hash tables. A hash table (also hash map) is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the correct value can be found.
Here is the source code of the Java program to implement separate chaining hash tables.
